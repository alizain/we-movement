      Net neutrality is the principle that Internet service providers treat all
      data on the Internet equally, and not discriminate or charge differently
      by user, content, website, platform, application, type of attached
      equipment, or method of communication. For instance, under these
      principles, internet service providers are unable to intentionally block,
      slow down or charge money for specific websites and online content.
